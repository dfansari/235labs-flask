# 235 Labs - Flask Application

This web application is built off of the Dash within Flask template from: 
https://hackersandslackers.com/plotly-dash-with-flask/

# Getting Started

Get set up locally in two steps:

### Environment Variables

Replace the values in **.env.example** with your values and rename this file to **.env**:

* `FLASK_APP`: Entry point of your application; should be `wsgi.py`.
* `FLASK_ENV`: The environment in which to run your application; either `development` or `production`.
* `SECRET_KEY`: Randomly generated string of characters used to encrypt your app's data.
* `LESS_BIN` *(optional for static assets)*: Path to your local LESS installation via `which lessc`.
* `ASSETS_DEBUG` *(optional)*: Debug asset creation and bundling in `development`.
* `LESS_RUN_IN_DEBUG` *(optional)*: Debug LESS while in `development`.
* `COMPRESSOR_DEBUG` *(optional)*: Debug asset compression while in `development`.


*Remember never to commit secrets saved in .env files to Github.*
